<h3 id="what-kind-of-individual-are-you">What kind of individual are you?</h3>

<p>You’re kind, thoughtful, driven, and talented.</p>

<p>You’ll  give it your all as we gather around the whiteboard to solve hard  problems and as you go heads-down to implement solutions. Our style of  work is high-autonomy, trust-driven, and focused on enabling deep work.  You’ll have the drive to turn that freedom into great work.</p>

<p>And  lastly, you’re sharp and getting sharper. You get excited when you think  about the size your impact could be on a small team. You have a big  appetite for learning and reflecting to broaden and deepen your skill set.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-beterra-like">What is Beterra like?</h3>

<p>We’re a privately held  self-funded company in Newnan, GA aiming to facilitate world-class  healthcare experiences and outcomes. The problems we’re currently solving are in the patient safety space. We help over 150 healthcare  organizations across 7 countries understand and improve their safety  culture, directly resulting in better outcomes for patients.</p>

<p>We  live and breathe healthy organizations, and we spend a lot of time  applying our domain learning to our own company. We believe culture is  far more than an office keg—it’s the values we live out and norms we put  in place that enable us to achieve our mission.</p>

<p>If we aren’t spending all of our afternoons around the office keg, what benefits does Beterra offer?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Flexible PTO with a minimum of 2 weeks</li>
  <li>100% medical coverage for you and your dependents</li>
  <li>A remote culture (though we do have an office in Newnan if you’re local)</li>
  <li>Whatever workspace tools you need to produce great work</li>
  <li>The resources you need to learn and grow</li>
</ul>
