          It's now been roughly two years since I decided I'd had enough of Microsoft and went in search of greener (or at least less annoying) pastures. It seems a reasonable time to sum up how it's been going again.<br><br>First off, it's safe to say that I'm a <a href="http://workingwithrails.com/person/7738-mike-gunderloy">Rails developer</a> now. I dabbled in a few other things (and I'm always up for learning more), but for me, Rails has offered the right balance between pleasure of development and being able to find interesting work that puts food on the table. My hourly rate for Rails is still not what my hourly rate for .NET was, but I'm OK with that tradeoff.<br><br>With two years of Rails work under my belt, I've moved to the point where I'm starting to contribute to the framework. Perhaps not surprisingly to those who know my history, I've figured out that the best spot for me to contribute is on the documentation side (although I have had one code change accepted to core). I'm helping out with the <a href="http://github.com/lifo/docrails/tree/master">docrails</a> project (which is producing, among other things, the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/">Rails Guides</a>) and contributing the weekly "edge Rails" roundups for the <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/">Riding Rails</a> weblog. I've also started writing for <a href="http://www.railsinside.com/">Rails Inside</a> and <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/">Ruby Inside</a>.<br><br>I also find myself playing Pied Piper and helping other people make the transition from .NET to Rails - including Dana Jones, who happens to be my wife as well as a designer and developer in her own right (so now we have two Rails developers in the office and yes, we are available for hire). I won't say this is the career path for everyone, but it's certainly worked for me.<br><br>All in all, I'm happy with where my career stands right now. Sure, we could be busier, and the hourly rates could be higher, but that's always the case (and I have some other plans up my sleeve to help move in that direction). Overall, the increased happiness factor has made the transition more than worth it.

          If you develop Rails applications, you're probably used to seeing this sort of thing in your log files:<br><br><a href="http://skitch.com/mikeg1/7y71/terminal-ruby-164x64"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-601" title="terminalthumb" src="../../squarespace_images/production_456608_5130307_files_2008_11_terminalthumb.png_" alt="terminalthumb" width="150" height="139"></a><br><br>Really, the only important thing there (as far as helping me find the source of the error) is the very first line of the backtrace: <code>ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid (SQLite3::SQLException: no such table: posts: SELECT * FROM "posts" ):</code>. But Rails throws in another 55 lines of backtrace information, just in case I have exposed a bug somewhere in Active Record or Action Pack or the dispatcher or Mongrel or Rack or even the initial script/server command. In most cases, that's just noise.<br><br>Rails 2.3 (inspired by Thoughtbot's <a href="http://www.thoughtbot.com/projects/quietbacktrace">Quiet Backtrace</a> plugin) is smart enough to just shut up about the parts I don't care. Here's the default Rails 2.3 log in the same situation:<br><br>[sourcecode language='ruby']<br>Processing PostsController#index (for 127.0.0.1 at 2008-11-29 08:12:31) [GET]<br>  Post Load (0.0ms)   SQLite3::SQLException: no such table: posts: SELECT * FROM "posts" <br><br>ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid (SQLite3::SQLException: no such table: posts: SELECT * FROM "posts" ):<br>  /app/controllers/posts_controller.rb:5:in `index'<br><br>Rendered /Users/mike/scratch/blog23/vendor/rails/actionpack/lib/action_controller/templates/rescues/_trace (18.0ms)<br>Rendered /Users/mike/scratch/blog23/vendor/rails/actionpack/lib/action_controller/templates/rescues/_request_and_response (0.6ms)<br>Rendering /Users/mike/scratch/blog23/vendor/rails/actionpack/lib/action_controller/templates/rescues/layout.erb (internal_server_error)<br>Completed in 34ms (DB: 0) | 500 Internal Server Error [http://localhost/posts]<br>[/sourcecode]<br><br>Much nicer. Rails uses a combination of <em>silencers</em> (which just throw away lines matching a particular pattern) and <em>filters</em> (which make regex-based substitutions) to clean up the backtrace.<br><br>The guts of the backtrace cleaner are in ActiveSupport::BacktraceCleaner, letting you set up your own cleaners. Most of us, though, will be using the default backtrace cleaner that Rails spins up during initialization, Rails::BacktraceCleaner. Rails adds a variety of filters and silencers "out of the box":<br><br>[sourcecode language='ruby']<br>ERB_METHOD_SIG = /:in `_run_erb_.*/<br><br>VENDOR_DIRS  = %w( vendor/plugins vendor/gems vendor/rails )<br>SERVER_DIRS  = %w( lib/mongrel bin/mongrel lib/rack )<br>RAILS_NOISE  = %w( script/server )<br>RUBY_NOISE   = %w( rubygems/custom_require benchmark.rb )<br><br>ALL_NOISE    = VENDOR_DIRS + SERVER_DIRS + RAILS_NOISE + RUBY_NOISE<br><br>def initialize<br>  super<br>  add_filter   { |line| line.sub(RAILS_ROOT, '') }<br>  add_filter   { |line| line.sub(ERB_METHOD_SIG, '') }<br>  add_filter   { |line| line.sub('./', '/') } # for tests<br>  add_silencer { |line| ALL_NOISE.any? { |dir| line.include?(dir) } }<br>end<br>[/sourcecode]<br><br>So, by default, Rails will throw away all the messages from the vendor folders and the servers, among other things. Naturally, you can change these defaults. Rails 2.3 adds a config/initializers/backtrace_silencers.rb file to your application. You can add your own silencers or filters in this file:<br><br>[sourcecode language='ruby']<br>Rails.backtrace_cleaner.add_silencer { |line| line =~ /my_noisy_library/ }<br>[/sourcecode]<br><br>You can also tell Rails to remove the default silencers if you're worried that you have uncovered a deeper bug:<br><br>[sourcecode language='ruby']<br>Rails.backtrace_cleaner.remove_silencers!<br>[/sourcecode]<br><br>Because the silencer is set up during the initialization process, you need to restart the server if you make any changes to it.<br><br>Currently in edge, the in-browser backtrace pages that you get in development mode show the full backtrace, not the silenced one.

          I recently hit a situation where I needed to sort an array of ActiveRecord objects on a particular attribute. The catch was that in this case the array started out with the results of a find operation - but then it had a bunch more transient objects added to it that weren't part of the database. Fortunately the Array#sort method makes short work of this. Given an array <code>a</code> of objects with an <code>entry_date</code> attribute:<br><br>[sourcecode language='ruby']<br>a.sort! {|x,y| x.entry_date &lt;=&gt; y.entry_date}<br>[/sourcecode]<br><br>Because this was the only sort I needed on this particular model, I decided to push the operation right down into the model:<br><br>[sourcecode language='ruby']<br>class Receipt &lt; ActiveRecord::Base<br>  def &lt;=&gt; (other)<br>    entry_date &lt;=&gt; other.entry_date<br>  end<br>end<br>[/sourcecode]<br><br>Then the sort is much simpler:<br><br>[sourcecode language='ruby']<br>a.sort!<br>[/sourcecode]<br><br>Note that this technique only makes sense if your array isn't coming straight from the database. If you are retrieving records from the database, you're better off including an <code>:order</code> clause in your finder to let the database do the sorting.

          There has been an astounding amount of invective and discussion over a <a href="http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/22af62cf486721ee2e45bb720c42ac2f4121faf4">recent addition</a> to Rails. Briefly, if you have an array in Rails, you can now use ordinal numbers to get at the first ten members through aliases such as <code>Array#second</code>, <code>Array#third</code>, and so on. Some people are concerned about code bloat, some are concerned about lack of elegance, and DHH's judgment in writing this bit of code has been seriously challenged.<br><br>Well, I'm not happy either - because the changes <em>don't go far enough</em>. Let's add one more method to <code>Array</code> and be done with it:<br><br>[sourcecode language='ruby']<br>Class Array<br>  def by_ordinal(pos)<br>    self[pos.to_i - 1]<br>  end<br>end<br>[/sourcecode]<br><br>With this simple addition, you can refer to <code>Array.by_ordinal("3rd")</code>, <code>Array.by_ordinal("21st")</code>, or even <code>Array.by_ordinal("407th")</code>. As a bonus, the naming of the individual members is consistent with Rails' <code>Inflector#ordinalize</code> method. Please join me in pushing for this to be included in Rails core.

          Here's a commit message that showed up in the main Rails repository earlier today:<br><br><pre><code><br>BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE: Renamed application.rb to <br>application_controller.rb and removed all the special casing that was in <br>place to support the former. You must do this rename in your own <br>application when you upgrade to this version [DHH]<br></code></pre>
<br><br>Well, getting rid of special casing is great, and this commit does indeed simplify some of the Rails internals a bit. But I can hear some of my readers cursing: this seems like an arbitrary change just when Rails 2.2 is about to come out.<br><br>Fortunately, if you're moving to Rails 2.2, this won't affect you (yet). We're close enough to 2.2 final that the main repository has been branched: there's now a 2.2 stable branch (which is currently accepting very few bug fixes) and a master branch that's targeted at Rails 2.3, or perhaps Rails 3.0. This change - and some other big changes that have been committed over the past few days - is on the master branch.<br><br>So, for Rails 2.2, don't panic. On the other hand, if you're tracking edge Rails closely, the next few weeks are likely to be a time of vast change (and instability) as some pent-up major changes hit the repository. Be sure you know what you're cloning before you set up a new Rails application.

          Even though Rails 2.2 is officially in "release candidate" status, new features are still making their way into the source code tree. While we could debate the suitability of this from a release engineering point of view, some of the new features are certainly sweet. The latest is the addition of the <code>:only</code> and <code>:except</code> options to RESTful routes. <br><br>Normally, using <code>map.resources</code> creates routes for all seven of the default actions (index, show, new, create, edit, update, and destroy) for the resource. But in Rails 2.2 (or in the current edge builds), you can fine-tune this behavior. The <code>:only</code> option specifies that only certain routes should be generated:<br><br>[sourcecode language='ruby']<br>map.resources :customers, :only =&gt; [:index, :show, :destroy]<br>[/sourcecode]<br><br>As with most places in Rails, you can use <code>:except</code> as the opposite of <code>:only</code>:<br><br>[sourcecode language='ruby']<br>map.resources :customers, :except =&gt; :index<br>[/sourcecode]<br><br>That declaration would give you six of the seven default routes, omitting only a route for the index action.<br><br>In addition to an action or an array of actions, you can also supply the special symbols <code>:all</code> or <code>:none</code> to the <code>:only</code> and <code>:except</code> options.<br><br>Why do this? In addition to making your code easier to follow, the smaller you can make the routing table, the less memory it will take up - and the less processing time route recognition and generation will take. It can also lower the attack surface of your application by removing unused routes, which is a security win.<br>
