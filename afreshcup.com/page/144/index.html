          Four months into the year of giving up on Microsoft and here's where things stand...<br><ul>
<br>	<li>I'm actively working on my first Rails application for a paying client. It's not gone live yet, but we're on track to deploy June 1. I've cut my rate substantially in recognition that this is a learning experience for all concerned; fortunately, it's a client who I've got a good history of mutual respect with.</li>
<br>	<li>So far freelance work is keeping food on the table, between the one Rails app and various bits of writing. I'd like to get to where I'm doing more coding and less writing.</li>
<br>	<li>Second Life is the major distraction in my first life. I'm sniffing around some business opportunities there but nothing has gelled.</li>
<br>	<li>Traffic here at A Fresh Cup continues to rise roughly linearly every month. Thanks to all readers &amp; commenters.</li>
<br>	<li>Traffic over at <a href="http://www.larkware.com">Larkware</a> hasn't started dropping off yet,  but ad sales are declining and I'm clearly starting to lose touch with what Microsoft is up to. My self-imposed moratorium on covering anything after .NET 2.0 has made most of the news out of <span class="caps">MIX</span> this week irrelevant, for example. I just don't have time to keep up with their latest <strong>and</strong> reinvent my own career.</li>
<br>	<li>Looking forward to being at RailsConf in a couple of weeks. I'll be aggressively looking for more consulting opportunities there.</li>
<br>	<li>I did buy a Mac Book Pro to take to RailsConf with me, so the financial picture for the year as a whole is looking even less great. But then, that's not unexpected. As I've said all along, I'm willing to take a hit this year to get myself back on the right track.</li>

          I'm looking for a way to do a complex search across a variable set of multiple fields in a Rails form. In .NET, I'd just build up dynamic <span class="caps">SQL</span> by brute force, but that doesn't seem very Rails-ish, so I went hunting.<br><ul>
<br>	<li>
<a href="http://railsweenie.com/forums/5/topics/1411">Use find_by_sql and the join method</a> to build up a condition string. This is essentially the brute force method translated to Rails.</li>

<a href="http://woss.name/2006/10/10/railsconf-europe-2006-doing-business-with-ruby-on-rails/">ModelSearch</a> is a plugin that was demoed in one of the talks at RailsConf Europe 2006. It lets you do things like</li>
<br>
</ul>
<br><pre><br><code><br> search = ProductSearch.new<br> search.keyword = 'television'<br> search.max_price = 300<br> search.sort = :price<br> search.find(:all)<br></code></pre>
<br>This is cool, but it doesn't seem to have actually been released into the wild yet.<br><ul>
<br>	<li>
<a href="http://brainspl.at/articles/2006/01/30/i-have-been-busy">ez-where</a> is a plugin from Brainsplat (more info <a href="http://brainspl.at/articles/2006/06/30/new-release-of-ez_where-plugin">here</a> and <a href="http://brainspl.at/articles/2006/10/03/nested-joins-and-ez-where-update#comments">here</a>). It enables things like</li>
<br>
</ul>
<br><pre><br><code><br> articles = Article.find_where(:all) do |article|<br>   article.title =~ 'Lorem%'<br>   article.author.name  'Ezra'<br>   article.comments.user.name  ‘Fab’<br> end<br></code></pre>
<br><ul>
<br>	<li>
<a href="http://thoughtbot.com/projects/squirrel">Squirrel</a> is another plugin inspired by ez-where. It has a similar syntax and includes pagination support.</li>
<br>
</ul>
<br>Right at the moment I'm inclining towards using Squirrel to meet my requirements.

          3 months into the 12-month clock for reinventing my career, so it's time to take stock again:<br><ul>
<br>	<li>I quit my full-time .NET consulting job, effective last Friday. This was 9 months sooner than originally planned, but the time was right for a lot of reasons. This means that I'm definitely interested in talking to people who want to hire a freelancer (though I'm actually fairly busy for the month of April already). While I expect to take on some more .NET work to hold things together, my first preference is going to go to Rails work if I can find any, even if that means substantially discounting my rate.</li>
<br>	<li>I didn't do a lot of Rails work in March, mainly through lack of time (which is one reason for the sudden change of job status). I did find time to explore some of the interfaces between Rails code and <span class="caps">LSL</span>, the scripting language used in Second Life, which has been fun if not terribly instructive or lucrative. This has also led me to the Rubyists of Second Life group, which may end up being my local user's group (for some value of "local").</li>
<br>	<li>I'm now writing daily pieces for <a href="http://webworkerdaily.com">Web Worker Daily</a> . This isn't going to be money to live on, and I don't expect to be a full-time writer, but it's good fill-in money and I enjoy having the new direction to stretch in. Good new set of contacts, too.</li>
<br>	<li>Traffic on this blog is still going up, roughly linearly by month. That's good, though I still need to figure out what all the doubling in the <span class="caps">XML</span> feed is about.</li>
<br>	<li>I'll definitely be trolling for business at RailsConf. During April I need to figure out what to do about a Mac Book (Pro?) to take along with me. At this point, roughly 75% of my daily desktop work is now on the Mac, so bringing a Windows laptop along isn't going to cut it.</li>
