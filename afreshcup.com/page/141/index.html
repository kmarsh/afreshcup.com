Pre-move preparations (we're headed from Washington state to Indiana on October 6) are taking an increasing amount of scarce time.

This should change in a month or so.<br><br>Also, a bit of advance warning: <em>A Fresh Cup</em> will be going offline from October 4 until I'm not sure when, as the server that it's running  on will be packed and moving across the country with me.

          8 months in to retooling my career, and things are still going well, if a trifle hectic:<br><ul>
<br>	<li>Both of the clients I've been doing Rails work for have extended their initial contracts with additional work, which strikes me as a pretty good vote of confidence.</li>
<br>	<li>I've started building out another Rails application that we'll be using as a springboard for a new business as my better half transitions careers herself.</li>
<br>	<li>The prospect of work in Second Life remains live, though on the back burner as the prospective client is still getting corporate funding in place. I had another promising chat the other day though, and continue to hone my skills (and have fun) on that platform.</li>
<br>	<li>Daily postings at Web Worker Daily are keeping me in practice as a short-order writer, as well as bringing in a bit of side income.</li>
<br>	<li>Life is more chaotic than usual, with our impending move to Evansville, Indiana being set for about a month from now.</li>

          I know, the stuttering <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed is incredibly annoying. It annoys me too. But my todo list is a mile long...excuses, excuses...<br><ul>

<a href="http://darwinweb.net/article/Php_Semantics_In_Railsuse_Blank"><span class="caps">PHP</span> Semantics in Rails:Use Blank?</a> - Just a reminder that Rails defines the handy <code>?blank</code> on everything. Bad enough that I don't have many of the Ruby core methods memorized yet, there's all the Rails extensions to remember too. Oh well, this is why I'm continually reading books and documentation and source. At some point bits and pieces sink in (and next year I'll be embarrassed to read the code I'm writing this year, too).</li>
<br>	<li>
<a href="http://www.openproj.com/">OpenProj</a> - Cross-platform, open-source, free replacement for Microsoft Project. I had a little play with this, since I do occasionally like to track things with Gantt charts (yes, I know they're not ideally suited for everything, but I've got an industrial engineering degree, OK?). On the plus side, it does seem to work fine, and opens Microsoft Project files without a problem. On the minus side, it's a Java app, which means that the UI is equally nonstandard and annoying on all platforms.</li>
<br>	<li>
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-talk/browse_thread/thread/547936d0883b5fd3/86bddbb9124dce8e?lnk=gst&amp;q=DEPRECATION+WARNING&amp;rnum=14#86bddbb9124dce8e">Bug in @flash deprecation?</a> - I've been getting annoying warnings about using @flash in one of my Rails projects even though it's nowhere in sight.

          Ran across a few more things worth passing along:<br><ul>
<br>	<li>
<a href="http://vmware.com/products/fusion/">VMware Fusion</a> - This one officially released yesterday. Given my history with VMware (I've been using their Windows products since 1.0) one of the reasons I went with a powerful Mac was so that I could run Fusion and virtualize Windows as a backup plan in case I got stuck trying to transition something away from Microsoft. Now, I expect to never actually install this.</li>
<br>	<li>
<a href="http://cynicalpeak.com/cyndicate/">Cyndicate</a> - New commercial 3-pane <span class="caps">RSS</span> reader for the Mac that so far is working quite well for me. I would stick with the free Vienna, except Vienna freezes for me fetching the news now that I've got 200+ feeds loaded in it. And before you offer other alternatives, you should know that I detest online readers, and I think 2-pane newsreader UI sucks crap through a soda straw when you're trying to scan and organize a huge number of feeds.</li>

          Whoops, I'm a bit late with my report after 7 months of transition away from Microsoft and on to freer pastures. Life, as they say, has been getting in the way.<br><ul>
<br>	<li>At this point, I pretty much do not touch the Windows box except to put together the <a href="http://www.larkware.com">Daily Grind</a> and to keep up my business bookkeeping in QuickBooks. My accountant is pretty well tied to the latter. We're planning a physical move across the country later this year, if all goes well, which will probably provide an opportunity for switching accountants and accounting packages.</li>
<br>	<li>I haven't written a line of code in anything other than Ruby (and more specifically RoR) in the last month. The two active Rails projects I have are moving along fine. I'm getting in good amounts of billable hours at a decent rate, both clients are happy, and I'm on track to complete the work on time and under budget.</li>
<br>	<li>The "on time and under budget" part is a two-edged sword: it's getting to the point where I ought to be scratching for more work again, though I also need to follow up with the existing customers to see whether they want to extend the engagements.</li>
<br>	<li>More and more I know what I'm doing in RoR without having to look it up, though I still am far from true expertise in the environment. I still need to really be pounding out more code every day to get to that point. I've always learned computer languages by immersion with reference materials handy, though, so I'm satisfied with this state of affairs.</li>
<br>	<li>We recently purchased our second island in Second Life, and rentals are starting to throw off some profit at a decent <span class="caps">ROI</span>. So while SL doesn't look as likely to turn into a full-time job as it did a couple of months ago, it may yet become a reasonably profitable hobby.</li>
