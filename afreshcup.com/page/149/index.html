<br>	<li>There are a zillion things that I know how to do in the Microsoft universe (like copying databases from one server to another) that I need to relearn as I move sideways to a world of other software. This is a cost above and beyond whatever I spend on new hardware and software and directly learning my new core competency.</li>
<br>	<li>Fortunately, it's all out on the net somewhere, and I'm darned good at hunting things down quickly.</li>

          As you've probably noticed, things have changed around here. I've migrated the site from <a href="http://ozimodo.rubyforge.org/">ozimodo</a> to <a href="http://mephistoblog.com/">Mephisto</a> . While the new software does look much spiffier, the main driver for this was simple: Mephisto supports comments out of the box. I've been getting a rather surprising (to me, at least) amount of e-mail over my postings on this site. Now you folks can play along right here and everyone can benefit from the back-and-forth. At least, that's the plan.

          There's that old saying about being able to recognize the pioneers because they're the ones with the arrows in their backs.

Now I've settled in for some more serious development. I spent a couple of hours yesterday working with Rails on the Mac, poking along at my first "real" (as opposed to tutorial) application. I'm not ready to announce it yet, but hopefully I'll have something to show off within a week or two.<br><br>Rails development continues to agree with me. Lots to learn but the pieces fit together in a sensible manner.<br><br>I'm proceeding up the Mac learning curve reasonably well, with pauses to try to hunt down tools and utilities I need. There's not nearly as many choices on the Mac side as on the Windows side, but I knew that going in. Perhaps that will translate to market opportunity for me at some point.<br><br>A reader wrote to ask how many hours a day my personal "20% time" comes to. I've been allocating not less than an hour a day to this effort. Now that I have the dev environment set up, I expect to up that to two hours most days. As the year goes on and I transition into whatever my new career turns out to be, hopefully that will grow.

          Well, the new Mac is here and happily chugging along. I haven't started coding on it yet, though I have installed a batch of software. A few initial thoughts:<br><ul>
<br>	<li>It sure is purty, in an industrial design sort of way. But I suspect it could have been $50 cheaper if the case wasn't so overdesigned, and the keyboard and mouse frankly suck as far as I'm concerned (your ergonomic preferences may vary of course). I'm almost certainly going to pitch the Mighty Mouse in favor of a decent trackball. Unfortunately Unicomp doesn't make a Mac keyboard, so I don't know what I'm going to do in that department.</li>
<br>	<li>
<span class="caps">OS X</span> is reasonably easy to transition to, but I was surprised at the lack of any obvious "start here" introduction for new users. People who say it's intuitive are full of poop (just like the people who say the same thing about Windows).</li>
<br>	<li>Some things, like getting hooked up to the Internet via my wireless access point, did indeed just work. But they just work in Windows these days too.</li>
<br>	<li>James Duncan Davidson's <a href="http://blog.duncandavidson.com/2006/04/sandboxing_rail.html">Guide for Installing Rails on Mac</a> worked perfectly after I tracked down one broken link.</li>
<br>
</ul>
<br>Much more to come, I'm sure.

          Well, I've done several things lately to make progress on my quest to invent a new career not involving Microsoft:<br><ol>
<br>	<li>I let my current boss know that I expected not to be with the company past early 2008.</li>
<br>	<li>I spent a bundle of money on a new Mac (which should be here on Monday).</li>
<br>	<li>I've let the publishers I've been writing articles for know that I'm not interested in continuing to tackle Microsoft-related topics. This means an immediate income drop, but on the flipside it frees up some time.</li>
<br>	<li>I've started setting aside a solid, real, uninterrupted hour a day to work on new stuff - my equivalent of Google's "20% time," more or less. The past few days this time has gone to brainstorming on a few ideas for relatively small applications that I can (I hope) build with Ruby on Rails as a way to get some hands-on time in that environment. Next week I plan to pick one and start building.</li>
<br>
</ol>
<br>To sum it up, I've been slowly snipping away my safety net, in the hopes of forcing myself into a new world. With any luck, this strategy will work.

          Like a lot of other geeks, I paid some attention to the keynote at MacWorld yesterday. Though nothing announced there really interested me (oh, the iPhone looks like a fairly sexy bit of engineering, though it's a perplexingly stupid decision to not let users install their own software on it, but I don't carry a cel phone), I hopped over to the Apple store yesterday afternoon anyhow. That's because I was just waiting to see if there was any changes in the Mac Pro lineup before ordering one.<br><br>So, a couple weeks from now I should have a Mac sitting on (well, under) my desk along with the Windows and Linux boxes. I also splurged a bit and treated myself to a new Dell 24" monitor. I figure I'm going to cover about half the cost of this system by not renewing my <span class="caps">MSDN</span> subscription this year. Now it's time to get serious about spending a couple hours each day working on new skills.
