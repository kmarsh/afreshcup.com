          Observant readers will have noted that I've been digging into <span class="caps">LSL</span> lately, along with Rails. <span class="caps">LSL</span> is the scripting language for <a href="http://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> , the virtual world created by Linden Research and its residents. There doesn't seem to be much "official" documentation for <span class="caps">LSL</span>, but it's reasonably well described in the <a href="http://www.lslwiki.net/lslwiki/wakka.php?wakka=HomePage"><span class="caps">LSL</span> wiki</a> . It's a vaguely C-like scripting language with some interesting quirks (for instance, there's no reasonable way to store persistent data). It does, however, have the ability to make both <span class="caps">HTTP</span> and <span class="caps">XMLRPC</span> calls to servers outside of SL, which means that it's perfectly possible to create objects in SL that talk to a Rails application out in "First Life" - which is what I've been pursuing.<br><br>The interesting thing about Second Life is that it has a whole shadow economy going on, with a currency of lindens that are reasonably liquid and that do exchange with US dollars (one way in which Linden Labs makes their money is by taking a substantial rake off of such exchanges between players - if I sell you lindens for dollars, the house gets a cut). Some people have famously made enough lindens that their full-time job is now working in Second Life. I strongly suspect there is a steep, steep power law at work here, with the few poster children making good money, more making walking-around money, and many more making essentially nothing at all.<br><br>Still, playing with this stuff (and it is on some crazy boundary between work and play) does give me the chance to work with some more Rails code, and it does offer at least the potential that I could end up on the right portion of that power curve. I've got some ideas for goods and services that I don't see being well-executed within the Second Life economy yet. So, who knows - it's worth spending at least a few hours looking into this as a part of the next career.

          Two months into the year. That's 1/6 of the time I have allotted myself for throwing out the old career and bringing in the new. Time to take stock again.<br><br>I continue to get more comfortable working in Rails, and have put up several sites using this framework, though nothing too spectacular and all works in progress (links over in the sidebar). But given that the best way to learn a new language is to write code, and I'm writing code every night, I'm happy with that. I'm also doing lots of reading. I'm sure there are plenty more "aha!" moments ahead of me, and I would hardly claim to be fluent in Rails yet, but the pieces are fitting together for me, and with books at my side I can usually make it do what I want with some research time.<br><br>I need to somehow find more reading time; there are several books that I want to finish (including <strong>Programming Ruby</strong> and <strong>Mac <span class="caps">OS X</span>: The Missing Manual</strong> that I just haven't had time for. Part of the problem is that these books are too darned big to read in the bath.<br><br>This blog has doubled in pageviews over the last month (which is good) despite the continued problem with doubles in the feed (which is bad). The latter, I think, is down to me making the domain available both with and without www, but I've not yet figured out how to solve the problem, even though I've made several abortive attempts to do so with both the Mephisto code and with Apache. I've noticed the same problem with some other Mephisto blogs in my own feed list. I haven't given up yet. Anyhow, I'll be happy if readership keeps going up at this rate; hopefully other people are finding the linky-posts useful.<br><br>As I've mentioned before, I'm going to RailsConf in May. My interim goal at this point is to feel confident enough of my Rails code by then that I can actually sniff around for some project involvement without feeling like an utter imposter.

          Well, I'm working on deploying another little Rails app, but I've hit an unexpected snag. I fired up a fresh Ubuntu server for this one, brought in all the latest bits, and now Capistrano is not playing nicely with it. I'm hitting the exact symptoms described in <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/capistrano/browse_thread/thread/3b8ec463330a8734/bd9a93fc3ca06efc?lnk=st&amp;q=cap+deploy+%22Can%27t+make+directory%22&amp;rnum=1&amp;hl=en#bd9a93fc3ca06efc">this message</a> but as no one has posted an answer knowing that the symptoms are not unique doesn't do me a whole boatload of good.<br><br>I could perhaps shove it on to the same server I'm using for other things, but there's a limit to how many mongrel instances I want to spin up on a single server when I have tons of unused computing capacity sitting around. Two differences between the servers may be salient - the working server is Ubuntu server and Capistrano , while the one that is being crabby is Ubuntu desktop and Capistrano 1.4.1. I suspect it's the Capistrano version that's making the difference 1.4.0, but what do I know? Not much.<br><br>I'd be grateful for any suggestions.
