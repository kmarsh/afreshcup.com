<a href="http://macitbetter.com/">BetterZip</a> - An actual GUI archive application for OS X. Not entirely sure this is worth paying for, though I do get annoyed at the lack of fine control over zip options that the OS gives by default.</li>

<a href="http://bitnami.org/stack/wordpress">BitNami WordPress stack</a> - This is what I used to install WordPress, and it was pretty painless. I did have to muck around in the Apache configuration files, though; by default it puts the install on port 8080 in the /wordpress folder.</li>

          If you're sharp-eyed (and your DNS server has picked up the new address for A Fresh Cup, which it must have, otherwise you wouldn't be reading this) you may have noticed some changes around here. The root cause is simple: I've decided to abandon the Rails-based <a href="http://mephistoblog.com/">Mephisto </a>and move to a locally-hosted copy of WordPress instead. There were just too many little things about Mephisto nagging at me and I just wasn't finding time to fix them.<br><br>I considered putting time in to customize Mephisto, or to move forward to edge Mephisto, or to switch to one of the other Rails systems like Type or SimpleLog. But ultimately, I came to the conclusion that tweaking blog software isn't really something I want to spend time on. There are good, mature, open-source systems available, so I might as well run one of them and get on with the rest of my life and business.<br><br>The change is not, alas, completely painless. WordPress does not understand how to import from Mephisto, so I hacked together a bridge for the past content via RSS. But I didn't move tags or comments (and I doubt I will ever find the time to do so). And the URLs for individual articles have changed (bad blogger, no biscuit). But moving forward, I hope, things should be stable.

(Yeah, I'm a wimp that way). This one has the advantage of being free, though it's not real well-organized and has that Qt look to it.</li>
