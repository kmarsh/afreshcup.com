          You probably already know (well, if you're a Rails developer) that you can use <code>to_xml</code> or <code>to_json</code> to quickly get XML or JSON representations of Active Record model instances. But did you know that these methods are configurable? By default they simply dump all of the attributes of the model along with their values, but if you want to do something different, you can - and usually without overriding the base methods.<br><br>To start, you can specify exactly which attributes to export with the <code>:only</code> or <code>:except</code> options:<br><br>[sourcecode language='ruby']<br>@user.to_xml :only =&gt; [ :name, :phone ]<br>@user.to_xml :except =&gt; :password <br>@user.to_json :only =&gt; [ :name, :phone ]<br>@user.to_json :except =&gt; :password <br>[/sourcecode]<br><br>You can include associated records, nesting as needed, with the <code>:include</code> option:<br><br>[sourcecode language='ruby']<br>@user.to_xml :include =&gt; {:orders =&gt; <br>  { :include =&gt; [:shipments, :backorders] }}<br> @user.to_json {:orders =&gt; <br>  { :include =&gt; [:shipments, :backorders] }}<br>[/sourcecode]<br><br><code>:only</code> and <code>:except</code> also work on includes:<br><br>[sourcecode language='ruby']<br>@user.to_xml :include =&gt; {:orders =&gt; <br>  { :include =&gt; [:shipments, :backorders] },<br>  :only =&gt; :order_date }<br>@user.to_json {:orders =&gt; <br>  { :include =&gt; [:shipments, :backorders] },<br>  :only =&gt; :order_date }<br>[/sourcecode]<br><br>You can create XML or JSON attributes from model methods by using the <code>:methods</code> option:<br><br>[sourcecode language='ruby']<br>@user.to_xml :methods =&gt; :permalink<br>@user.to_json :methods =&gt; :permalink <br>[/sourcecode]<br><br>Additionally, there are some options that apply only to <code>to_xml</code>. <code>:skip_instruct</code> suppresses the XML processing instruction. <code>:skip_types</code> suppresses the output of types to the XML. <code>:dasherize =&gt; false</code> turns off dasherization of column names.

          If you take a look at the Rails source code, you'll find numerous useful comments like this one from ActionController::Base:<br><br>[sourcecode language='ruby']    <br># All requests are considered local by default, so everyone <br># will be exposed to detailed debugging screens on errors.<br># When the application is ready to go public, this should be set to <br># false, and the protected method <tt>local_request?</tt><br># should instead be implemented in the controller to determine <br># when debugging screens should be shown.<br>@@consider_all_requests_local = true<br>cattr_accessor :consider_all_requests_local<br>[/sourcecode]<br><br>But if you check your <a href="http://apidock.com/rails">favorite Rails API site</a> for documentation of <code>consider_all_requests_local</code>, you'll come up blank. What's up?<br><br>I spent some time chasing this, and it turns out to be a conflict between the way that Rails is commented and the way that rdoc thinks things should be done. There's actually <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.org/attachment/ticket/10424/documenting_cattr_accessors.rb">a ticket in the old Rails Trac</a> with a proposed resolution for this. As it happens, that ticket isn't quite right, but it provoked rdoc into changing things. The secret lies in the rdoc 2.x support for <a href="http://rdoc.rubyforge.org/classes/RDoc/Parser/Ruby.html">documenting metaprogrammed methods</a>.<br><br>To properly document <code>cattr_accessor</code> (and similar) declarations in your own Rails code, you need to do two things. First, upgrade from your musty old rdoc 1.0.1 to a <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rdoc">more recent version</a> - 2.2.1 is current. If you look at their downloads you will find there is a gem version, <em>but</em> just installing this may not be enough: putting the gem on my system gave me rdoc 2 from the command line but rdoc 1 from rake tasks. That's because (at least on my Mac), rdoc is also out there in the ruby/1.8 standard tree, and so I had to replace the 1.0.1 there with the new bits.<br><br>Second, you need to change your markup comments to tell rdoc that this is a metaprogrammed method. Here's the revision for that method from ActiveController::Base:<br><br>[sourcecode language='ruby']    <br>@@consider_all_requests_local = true<br>##<br># :singleton-method:<br># All requests are considered local by default, so everyone <br># will be exposed to detailed debugging screens on errors.<br># When the application is ready to go public, this should be set to <br># false, and the protected method <tt>local_request?</tt><br># should instead be implemented in the controller to determine <br># when debugging screens should be shown.<br>cattr_accessor :consider_all_requests_local<br>[/sourcecode]<br><br>The <code>##</code> indicator tells rdoc that this is a metaprogrammed method, which means it will ignore the first token on the declaration and pick up the second one as the method name. The <code># :singleton-method#</code> indicator tells rdoc to document this as a class method rather than as an instance method.<br><br>The Rails Documentation team is exploring how we'll fix up the core Rails source to use the new markers. Meanwhile, you should start using this anywhere that you have the <code>cattr</code> methods in your own code or plugins - and upgrade your rdoc bits in anticipation.

          In Rails 2.2, if you include a belongs_to or references column in a call to the model generator, it will automatically add the belongs_to declaration to the model, as well as creating the foreign key column in the migration.<br><br>For example, run this from the command line:<br><br><code>script/generate model order order_date:datetime customer:belongs_to</code><br><br>And you'll find that the generated Order model looks like this:<br><br>[sourcecode language='ruby']<br>class Order &lt; ActiveRecord::Base<br>  belongs_to :customer<br>end<br>[/sourcecode]<br><br>Nothing earthshaking, but it will save you a few keystrokes.<br><br>Personally, I think we ought to explore the possibilities of making the model generator much more full-featured. I don't see any reason why it couldn't build validations, associations, and accessibility declarations at generation time. As a first step on this road, I've submitted a <a href="http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/1315-extend-model-generator-to-create-association-declarations">Rails patch</a>. If you like the idea (and you've got a copy of edge hanging around), go give it a try and let me know what you think.<br>

          It seems that a lot of the Rails applications I've been working on have a User model that has a many-to-many relation with a Role model, so that users can have a role like "admin" or "manager", or even multiple roles. Along with this comes the necessity to conditionally show things in views. Recently I've started moving away from having explicit @current_user.has_role("whatever") calls in the views, to some code in the application_helper.rb file:<br><br>[sourcecode language='ruby']<br>module ApplicationHelper<br><br>  def admin_only(&amp;block)<br>    role_only("administrator", &amp;block)<br>  end<br>  <br>  def manager_only(&amp;block)<br>    role_only("manager", &amp;block)<br>  end<br><br>private<br>  <br>  def role_only(rolename, &amp;block)<br>    if not @current_user.blank? and @current_user.has_role?(rolename)<br>      block.call<br>    end<br>  end<br>end<br>[/sourcecode]<br><br>Now in views I can easily mark off sections that should be displayed to only one user type:<br><br>[sourcecode language='ruby']<br><br>  <!-- administrator content goes here --><br><br><br>  <!-- manager content goes here --><br><br>[/sourcecode]<br><br>It would be easy to extend the role_only method to take an array of roles and check for membership in any of them, but I haven't had need of that yet.<br><br>Hat tip to <a href="http://www.newmedialogic.com/">Aaron Longwell</a> for introducing me to this technique.

          The Rails Envy guys, Gregg Pollack and Jason Seifer, are back with another of their "<strong><a href="http://envycasts.com/">Envycast</a></strong>" screencasts: 45 minutes about Ruby on Rails 2.2, which is scheduled to be released realsoonnow. They were kind enough to send me a review copy (which means, yes, I didn't pay for it), and here are some impressions.<br><br>You certainly get enough for your money when you purchase their "Package Deal" for $16: the screencast itself in QuickTime, iPod/iPhone, and Ogg Theora formats, a 120-page PDF ebook by Carlos Brando in English and Portuguese, and a set of code samples (you can also buy the video or the ebook separately for $9 each).<br><br>Let's take the pieces one at a time. Unlike some other screencasts, the Rails Envy guys are using green-screen technology to insert themselves in front of the slides and code samples. This adds some action to what might otherwise be a pretty dry pile of information though (fortunately, I think) the cheesy jokes are not as non-stop as in their classic "<a href="http://www.railsenvy.com/tags/Commercials">Ruby on Rails vs.</a><br>" commercials. They pack a pretty good amount of information into the screencast, touching on dozens of new features in the time they have; in some areas, they're more comprehensive than the official release notes.<br><br>The PDF is even more comprehensive than the screencast; it covers a ton of stuff out of the changelogs, with code samples and explanations (in fact, it includes the changelogs as an appendix). If you want a complete overview of the changes coming down the pike for Rails 2.2, the PDF is the single best resource I've seen so far.<br><br>The code samples parallel the ebook; they're set up as a series of tests, so you can run rake against it (this will be useful as 2.2 proceeds from RC1 to release, to see what might have changed), or dig in to test cases to see the new functionality in action.<br><br>So, is it worth the money? Well, you could get all of this information elsewhere: the Rails changelogs and source code and git repository are all public. In theory, it's easy enough to look at the git logs going back from now to the 2.1 timeframe to see everything. But as someone who's done just that (to help compile the 2.2 release notes), I can tell you it's a non-trivial exercise. There's a lot of stuff in the commit log that doesn't make immediate sense, and there are older commits that have been changed by newer ones. This set of resources does all that work for you.<br><br>But, one caution: Rails 2.2 just reached the RC1 point, and while the code is mostly locked down, it's still changing. The odds are pretty good that some part of this material will be obsolete when Rails 2.2 actually ships - and while it should be easy enough for Rails Envy to update the code and ebook, I'm not sure what they'll do if there ends up being a bug in the screencast. Hopefully they have some plan for that.<br><br>If you're considering whether to upgrade to 2.2, these resources will give you an early look at how you stand to benefit (as well as listing which 2.1 bugs have been fixed). Personally, I think the video is overkill, but I'm not all that much of a screencast fan; I can scan and even read written material much faster. But the ebook is definitely a valuable addition to the written material on Rails, and at $9, it should be a trivial amount of money for any developer to spend to get up to speed.

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          There are a few guides floating around about how to contribute your own code to Rails. But none of them (or at least none of the ones that I found) walk you through every step of the way. So, here's an attempt to fill that gap.<br><br><strong>Step 0</strong>: Learn at least <em>something</em> about Ruby and Rails. If you don't understand the syntax of the language, common Ruby idioms, and the code that already exists in Rails, you're unlikely to be able to build a good patch (that is, one that will get accepted). You don't have to know every in-and-out of the language and the framework; some of the Rails code is fiendishly complex. But Rails is probably not appropriate as the first place that you ever write Ruby code. You should at least understand (though not necessarily memorize) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321445619?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=larkware-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321445619">The Rails Way</a><img style="border:none!important;margin:0!important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=larkware-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321445619" border="0" alt="amazon" width="1" height="1"><br>and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596516177?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=larkware-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0596516177">The Ruby Programming Language</a><img style="border:none!important;margin:0!important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=larkware-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0596516177" border="0" alt="amazon" width="1" height="1">.<br><br><strong>Step 1</strong>: Install git. You won't be able to do anything without the Rails source code, and this is a prerequisite. The <a href="http://git.or.cz/">git homepage</a> has installation instructions. If you're on OS X, use the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/">Git for OS X</a> installer. <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/everyday.html">Everyday Git</a> will teach you just enough about git to get by. The <a href="https://peepcode.com/products/git">PeepCode screencast on git</a> ($9) is easier to follow.<br><br><strong>Step 2</strong>: Get the Rails source code. Don't fork the main Rails repository. Instead, you want to clone it to your own computer. Navigate to the folder where you want the source code (it will create its own /rails subdirectory) and run:<br><br>[sourcecode language='ruby']<br>git clone git://github.com/rails/rails.git<br>[/sourcecode]<br><br><strong>Step 3</strong>: Set up and run the tests. All of the Rails tests must pass with any code you submit, otherwise you have no chance of getting code accepted. This means you need to be able to run the tests. For the tests that touch the database, this means creating the databases. With MySQL:<br><br>[sourcecode language='ruby']<br>mysql&gt; create database activerecord_unittest;<br>mysql&gt; create database activerecord_unittest2;<br>mysql&gt; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON activerecord_unittest.*<br>       to 'rails'@'localhost';<br>mysql&gt; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON activerecord_unittest2.*<br>       to 'rails'@'localhost';<br>[/sourcecode]<br><br>If you're using another database, check the files under activerecord/test/connections in the Rails source code for default connection information. You can edit these files if you must on your machine to provide different credentials, but obviously you should not push any changes back to Rails.<br><br>Now if you go back to the root of the Rails source on your machine and run rake with no parameters, you should see every test in all of the Rails components pass. After that, check out the file activerecord/RUNNING_UNIT_TESTS for information on running more targeted tests.<br><br><strong>Step 4</strong>: Fork Rails. You're not going to put your patches right into the master branch, OK? Think of a name for your new branch and run<br><br>[sourcecode language='ruby']<br>git checkout -b my_new_branch<br>[/sourcecode]<br><br>It doesn't really matter what name you use, because this branch will only exist on your local computer.<br><br><strong>Step 5</strong>: Write your code. You're on your branch now, so you can write whatever you want (you can check to make sure you're on the right branch with git branch -a). But if you're planning to submit your change back for inclusion in Rails, keep a few things in mind:<br>	<li>Get the code right</li>
<br>	<li>Include tests that fail without your code, and pass with it</li>
<br>	<li>Update the documentation</li>
<br><strong>Step 6</strong>: Sanity check. You know at least one other Rails developer, right? Show them what you're doing and ask for feedback. Doing this in private before you push a patch out publicly is the "smoke test" for a patch: if you can't convince one other developer of the beauty of your code, you're unlikely to convince the core team either.<br><br><strong>Step 7</strong>: Update your copy of Rails. It's pretty likely that other changes to core Rails have happened while you were working. Go get them:<br><br>[sourcecode language='ruby']<br>git checkout master<br>git pull<br>[/sourcecode]<br><br>Now reapply your patch on top of the latest changes:<br><br>[sourcecode language='ruby']<br>git checkout my_new_branch<br>git rebase master<br>[/sourcecode]<br><br>No conflicts? Tests still pass? Change still seems reasonable to you? Then move on.<br><br><strong>Step 8</strong>: Create your patch. Still in your branch, run<br><br>[sourcecode language='ruby']<br>git commit -a<br>git format-patch master --stdout &gt; my_new_patch.diff<br>[/sourcecode]<br><br>Sanity check the results of this operation: open the diff file in your text editor of choice and make sure that no unintended changes crept in.<br><br><strong>Step 9</strong>: Create a Lighthouse account. You will need one to send in a ticket with your patch. You can do this at the <a href="http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/users/new?to=%2Fprojects%2F8994-ruby-on-rails%2Ftickets%2Fnew">free signup page</a>.<br><br><strong>Step 10</strong>: Create a ticket with your patch. Go to the <strong><a href="http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994-ruby-on-rails/">Rails Lighthouse</a></strong> page. Sign in if necessary. Click on "Add New Ticket." Fill in a reasonable title and description, remember to attach your patch file, and tag the ticket with the 'patch' tag and whatever other subject area tags make sense.<br><br><strong>Step 11</strong>: Get some feedback. The Contributing to Rails page suggests using the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-core">rubyonrails-core</a> mailing list or the #rails-contrib channel on IRC freenode for this. You might also try just talking to Rails developers that you know.<br><br><strong>Step 12</strong>: Lather, rinse, release. It's entirely possible that the feedback you get will suggest changes. Don't get discouraged: the whole point of contributing to an active open source project is to tap into community knowledge. If people are encouraging you to tweak your code, then it's worth making the tweaks and resubmitting. If the feedback is that your code doesn't belong in the core, you might still think about releasing it as a plugin.<br><br>And then...think about your next contribution!

          There's a mismatch between the most recent Rails releases (2.1.2 and 2.2RC1) and older versions of RubyGems. Judging by what I've seen in various discussion fora, this is well on the way to being a FAQ. It's made more fun by the facts that<br>	<li>The error message doesn't implicate RubyGems</li>
<br>	<li>You may think you're up-to-date on RubyGems when you're not</li>
<br>If you're affected, you'll see this message when you try to run script/generate in a Rails application:<br><br>[sourcecode language='ruby']<br>undefined method empty?' for /_generator$/:Regexp<br>[/sourcecode]<br><br>If you see this, don't panic. It just means you need a newer RubyGems release. I'm not sure how current you need to be, but 1.1.1 is definitely too old. As I write this, 1.3.0 is current.<br><br>Now, in theory, to update to the latest version of RubyGems, you just need to run<br><br>[sourcecode language='ruby']<br>sudo gem update --system<br>[/sourcecode]<br><br><strong>But</strong> - depending on what version of RubyGems you have installed, running that command may <em>lie</em> and tell you that you have nothing to update. If you're currently on RubyGems 1.1 or 1.2, you need to run a different set of commands to update RubyGems:<br><br>[sourcecode language='ruby']<br>sudo gem install rubygems-update<br>sudo update_rubygems<br>[/sourcecode]<br><br>You can check your current RubyGems version with<br><br>[sourcecode language='ruby']<br>gem -v<br>[/sourcecode]<br>If it reports 1.3.0 or later, you should be good to use the recent Rails releases.

          There's a small change in Active Record behavior that's going to bite some existing applications under Rails 2.2: private methods on an association proxy are actually private. To illustrate, this code would work in Rails 2.1:<br><br>user.rb:<br><br>[sourcecode language='ruby']<br>class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base<br>  has_one :account<br>end<br>[/sourcecode]<br><br>account.rb:<br><br>[sourcecode language='ruby']<br>class Account &lt; ActiveRecord::Base<br>  belongs_to :user<br>  private<br>    def secret_code<br>      "ABCDE"<br>    end<br>end<br>[/sourcecode]<br><br>Controller code:<br><br>[sourcecode language='ruby']<br>@u = User.first<br>@code = u.account.secret_code<br>[/sourcecode]<br><br>With Rails 2.1, you'll actually get the secret code in @code, even though it comes from a private method of the account object. Rails 2.2 is stricter about this: that same code will fail with a NoMethodError. If you want to access a private method across an association proxy now, you'll need to use @code = u.account.send("secret_code").<br><br>Directly accessing private methods on an Active Record instance itself was already blocked in Rails 2.1, but Rails 2.2 updates that failure to give back a NoMethodError as well.
