        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>Today DHH announced <a href="https://github.com/rails/activestorage">Active Storage</a>: a new gem that makes it easy to attach Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage files to Active Record model instances. Looks like this is slated to become part of Rails in 5.2. I happen to have a Rails 5.2 application with a user model around, so here's a quick look at adding an avatar to that model with Active Storage.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This is early days for this library, so don't count on this post to be perfectly accurate if you're reading it months from now.</p>

<p>1. Add the gem to your Gemfile and run <code>bundle install</code></p>

<pre>gem 'activestorage', github: 'rails/activestorage'</pre>

<p>2. Add <code>require "active_storage"</code> to config/application.rb.</p>

<p>3. Run <code>rails activestorage:install</code>. This will create the storage and tmp/storage directories in your application, copy a default configuration file to config/storage_services.yml, and create a new migration. The migration will build the active_storage_blobs and active_storage_attachments tables in your database.</p>

<p>4. Run <code>rails db:migrate</code></p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> I had to change the class name in the migration from <code>ActiveStorage::CreateTables</code> to <code>ActiveStorageCreateTables</code> to get it to run without errors.</p>

<p>5. Add <code>config.active_storage.service = :local</code> to your development.rb file. This will use the preconfigured local-file storage when you're in the development environment.</p>

<p>6. Tell your User model that it has an attached file:</p>

<pre>class User &lt; ApplicationRecord
  has_one_attached :avatar
  ...
end</pre>

<p>7. Make a copy of your config/storage_services.yml file to config/storage_services_backup.yml. Then delete the amazon, google, and mirror sections from the original file. Otherwise, your server won't start, because it will be looking for keys and files that don't exist.</p>

<p>8. Add a field to your user edit form to input an avatar file:</p>

<pre>&lt;%= f.file_field :avatar, class: "form-control" %&gt;</pre>

<p>9. Add a control to your user show view to display the avatar:</p>

<pre>&lt;%= image_tag(@user.avatar.url) %&gt;</pre>

<p>10. Update your users controller to attach the file:</p>

<pre>  def update
    @user = User.find(params[:id])
    avatar = params[:user][:avatar]
    if @user.update(user_params)
      if avatar
        @user.avatar.attach(avatar)
      end
      redirect_to @user, notice: "Your profile has been updated"
    else
      render 'edit'
    end
  end</pre>

<p>11. Restart your application and navigate to <code>/users/&lt;id&gt;edit</code> to edit an existing user. Select a file and save the change. You should see the avatar image displayed on the edited user.</p>

<p>Of course, in production you'll want to use an actual cloud service. If you check your backed-up configuration file you'll see how to set up the keys for either S3 or AWS. Then it should just be a matter of setting the appropriate configuration in production.rb (note that I haven't tried this yet!)</p>

        </header>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>If you've been following along:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong><a href="../../home/2017/07/06/introduction-to-active-storage.html">Part 1, Local files</a></strong></li>
	<li><strong><a href="../../home/2017/07/06/introduction-to-active-storage-part-2-amazon-s3.html">Part 2, AWS</a></strong></li>
	<li><strong><a href="../../home/2017/07/06/introduction-to-active-storage-part-3-google-cloud-storage.html">Part 3, GCS</a></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Then you're ready for one of the cool features of Active Storage: mirroring. This one is really easy to set up:</p>

<p>1. Ensure that you have created <code>amazon</code>, <code>local</code>, and <code>google</code> sections in your storage_services.yml file, and that you have tested both of them.

</p>
<p>2. Update your storage_services.yml file with a configuration stanza for mirroring:</p>

<pre>mirror:
  service: Mirror
  services: [ amazon, local, google ]</pre>

<p>3. Edit your production.rb file:</p>

<pre>config.active_storage.service = :mirror</pre>

<p>4. Deploy the application. You <em>should</em> still be able to add user avatars.</p>

<p>What does mirroring do? It gives you built-in redundancy against cloud service failures. In the case of the configuration above:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Files are uploaded to Amazon and Google, and stored locally.</li>
	<li>Files are served from Amazon (the first member of the services array)</li>
</ul>

<p>Should AWS go down for an entire region, you'd only need to change the services array in your config file, restart your server, and you'd be up and running again.</p>

<p><strong>BUT:</strong> Note the "<em>should</em>" in step 4. As I write this, this doesn't actually work with the code in the Active Storage repo, because the MirrorService doesn't get configured properly. See <a href="https://github.com/rails/activestorage/issues/9">issue 9</a>, which includes a quick and hacky patch for the Active Storage internals to get things working.</p>

        </header>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>And to complete the trifecta, here's how you can update the Active Storage code to use Google Cloud Storage:</p>

<p>1. Sign in to your Google Cloud Platform account and go to your console (the URL will be something like https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard).</p>

<p>2. You need to create a new project, and then a storage bucket inside of the project. Record the names for both so you can add them to your storage_services.yml file.</p>

<p>3. You'll need to use <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/wizard?api=storage-component.googleapis.com&amp;project=gstroop623-172916">GCS's API Manager</a> to create credentials for your new bucket. Create a set of credentials that use the Google Cloud Datastore API. Download your credentials as JSON and store a copy of the file in your project at config/gcs.json.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Obviously, you need to keep the keys in this file confidential. Don't check them into a public repository, for example. Manage it the same way you manage your database.yml or other files containing confidential information.</p>

<p>4. Update your storage_services.yml file with a configuration stanza for Google:</p>

<pre>google:
  service: GCS
  project: gstroop-******
  keyfile:
  bucket: ****-*******-9999 </pre>

<p>5. Add a line to your production.rb file:</p>

<pre>config.active_storage.service = :google</pre>

<p>6. Add the <code>google-cloud-storage</code> gem to your Gemfile and run <code>bundle install</code>.

</p>
<p>7. Deploy the application. You should now be able to add user avatars and have then stored in the GCS bucket that you configured.</p>

          <p>Moving along, here's how to move your Active Storage files over to Amazon S3:</p>

<p>1. Sign in to your AWS account and go to your S3 management console (the URL will be something like https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=us-west-2# depending on your region).</p>

<p>2. Create a new bucket (for this tutorial, I'll use <code>gstroop-production</code>). Grant public read access to the bucket.</p>

<p>3. Retrieve the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key for your AWS account. Better yet, create a new pair just for this application.</p>

<p>4. Update your storage_services.yml file with a configuration stanza for Amazon:</p>

<pre>amazon:
  service: S3
  access_key_id: AKIA************
  secret_access_key: *********************************************
  region: us-west-2
  bucket: gstroop-production</pre>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Obviously, you need to keep those keys confidential. Don't check them into a public repository, for example. You can use the <a href="http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#custom-secrets">Rails secrets file</a> to store them, or whatever other mechanism you prefer for production secrets.</p>

<p>5. Add a line to your production.rb file:</p>

<pre>config.active_storage.service = :amazon</pre>

<p>6. Add the <code>aws-sdk</code> gem to your Gemfile and run <code>bundle install</code>.

</p>
<p>7. Deploy the application. You should now be able to add user avatars and have then stored in the S3 bucket that you configured.</p>
