          Here I am, half a year into my experiment with cutting loose from Microsoft, and I think I can pronounce it a success:<br><ul>
<br>	<li>I now have two Rails consulting jobs running, and I'm as busy on that front as I want to be from now until about the end of August, which is about as far out as my consulting time has ever been assured. This doesn't mean that I'm not looking for more, but it means that I'm feeling a comfortable cushion, and a confidence that I'll find more work to keep the pipeline full. My Rails rate is nowhere near what my top C# rate was (or for that matter, what my top Netware rate was many years ago), but that's OK.</li>
<br>	<li>I've got a couple of leads on actual US-dollar paying Second Life work, which I am actively pursuing.</li>
<br>	<li>I still don't feel like I've reached the "expert" level with Rails yet, but at least I can get it to mostly do what I want with minimal fuss. The times when I go off the clock to research something are getting fewer and taking less time.</li>
<br>	<li>My .NET skills are rapidly deteriorating; I haven't written a line of C# or VB code in months.</li>
<br>	<li>I'm moved almost entirely to the Mac for my day-to-day work, with the exception of maintaining the <a href="http://www.larkware.com">Larkware</a> site.</li>

          I've finished getting my first production Rails server up and running at <a href="http://rimuhosting.com/">RimuHosting</a> . I kept reasonably careful notes along the way, and now I'm going to brain-dump them here, in part because I might need them again in the future, and in part because they might help someone else. Of course, there are so many variables that your setup very likely will not be a precise match for my setup, so use with appropriate caution.<br><br>We started with a MiroVPS3 (224MB) host with Debian Etch, the Webmin control panel, and RimuHosting's own basic Rails stack preinstalled. That's probably overkill for this little app, but the client wanted to be sure of plenty of breathing room. I'm targeting Apache + Mongrel for serving pages because that's what I've been using in development and staging; production is not the time to experiment with a new-to-me server.<br><ol>

          People tend to look askance at me when I tell them that I'm looking at two main avenues of revenue for replacing the .NET stuff that I'm giving the boot: Rails and Second Life. Rails they understand, but the thought that any adult might take Second Life seriously is still apparently a silly one to many people. So, time for a few words of explanation so that I can stop repeating myself.<br><br>Second Life is of interest to me on several levels. It has some game-like aspects, of course, and one can't neglect that it's fun (without having any particular goal) to hang out with online friends, just as <span class="caps">IRC</span> can be fun. And I do agree with those who think that some form of the 3D internet will take off over the next decade. While Second Life may not end up being the winning horse in that race (Linden Labs has plenty of opportunities to fail), it's one of the contenders and a good place to get some idea of what might work.<br><br>But from a business point of view, right now, it's also a place where real people make real incomes in real money. There are two distinct ways that this happens. First, there are around 100,000 paying customers (never mind the nearly 7 million signups; many of those don't stick around) putting hard currency into the Second Life economy. Linden Labs does manage to take a house rake on every transaction that involves converting real currency into Linden dollars or back, but much of that money comes back out again. The paying population is the size of a medium-sized real life city, and that's plenty big enough for some people to be making a living selling virtual stuff. Thanks to my wife's jewelry business, our membership costs are already covered, and we're on our way to being cashflow positive (not quite there yet, because we've invested in virtual land, but we'll be there well before year end and making extra income as well).<br><br>Second, there are consulting companies - "sherpa firms" - who make money by billing real money directly to first life companies who have come to the conclusion "Hey, we need some of that Second Life stuff" and who have no idea how to go about it. Creating a place in the world for the company down the street is the equivalent of building web sites a decade ago, and we're seeing a similar land rush just starting up. Right now most of this activity is big firms paying big dollars, but I expect we're going to see some commoditization over the next year or two. It's possible that one could make a decent living doing four-figure (US dollar) Second Life setups for small and medium businesses.<br><br>Anyhow, that's the basics. If you want to poke around, you can try out Second Life for free. If you do get in-world, you can find me by searching for MikeG1 Schumann and I'll be happy to chat with you there.
